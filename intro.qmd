- Rock defeats scissors, scissors defeats paper, and paper defeats rock
- You get +1 point for a win, -1 for a loss, and 0 for ties

## Why? 
We think RPS is fun and while it's simple enough that everyone knows it and understands the rules, it's still a great domain for thinking about strategy in a repeated game against a variety of opponents. 

From DeepMind in 2023:

> In sequential decision-making, agent evaluation has largely been restricted to few interactions against experts, with the aim to reach some desired level of performance (e.g. beating a human professional player). We propose a benchmark for multiagent learning based on repeated play of the simple game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## RPS game theory

### Payoff matrix
The core features of a game are its players, the actions of each player, and the payoffs. We can show this for RPS in the below payoff matrix, also known as normal-form.

| Player 1/2 | Rock    | Paper   | Scissors |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Rock**   | (0, 0)  | (-1, 1) | (1, -1)  |
| **Paper**  | (1, -1) | (0, 0)  | (-1, 1)  |
| **Scissors** | (-1, 1) | (1, -1) | (0, 0)   |

The **payoffs** for Player 1 are on the left and for Player 2 on the right in each payoff outcome of the game. For example, the bottom left payoff is when Player 1 plays Scissors and Player 2 plays Rock, resulting in -1 for P1 and +1 for P2. 

A **strategy** says which actions you would take for every state of the game.

### Expected value
**Expected value** in a game represents the average outcome of a strategy if it were repeated many times. Itâ€™s calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability of occurrence and then summing these products.

Suppose that Player 1 plays the strategy: 

$$
\begin{cases}
r_1 = 0.5 \\
p_1 = 0.25 \\
s_1 = 0.25
\end{cases}
$$

and Player 2 plays the strategy: 

$$
\begin{cases}
r_2 = 0.1 \\
p_2 = 0.3 \\
s_2 = 0.6
\end{cases}
$$

Let's add these to the matrix: 

| Player 1/2 | Rock ($r_2=0.1$)   | Paper ($p_2=0.3$)  | Scissors ($s_2=0.6$) |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Rock ($r_1=0.5$)**  | (0, 0)  | (-1, 1) | (1, -1)  |
| **Paper ($p_1=0.25$)** | (1, -1) | (0, 0)  | (-1, 1)  |
| **Scissors ($s_1=0.25$)** | (-1, 1) | (1, -1) | (0, 0)   |

To simplify, let's just write the payoffs for Player 1 since payoffs for Player 2 will simply be the opposite: 

| Player 1/2 | Rock ($r_2=0.1$)   | Paper ($p_2=0.3$)  | Scissors ($s_2=0.6$) |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Rock ($r_1=0.5$)**   | 0  | -1 | 1 |
| **Paper ($p_1=0.25$)** | 1 | 0  | -1 |
| **Scissors ($s_1=0.25$)** | -1 | 1 | 0 |

Now we can multiply the player action strategies together to get a percentage occurrence for each payoff in the matrix: 

| Player 1/2 | Rock ($r_2=0.1$)   | Paper ($p_2=0.3$)  | Scissors ($s_2=0.6$) |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Rock ($r_1=0.5$)**   | Val: $0$ <br>Pr: $0.5(0.1) = .05$ | Val: $-1$ <br>Pr: $0.5(0.3) = .15$ | Val: $1$ <br>Pr: $0.5(0.6) = .3$ |
| **Paper ($p_1=0.25$)** | Val: $1$ <br>Pr: $0.25(0.1) = .025$ | Val: $0$  <br>Pr: $0.25(0.3) = .075$ | Val: $-1$ <br>Pr: $0.25(0.6) = .15$ |
| **Scissors ($s_1=0.25$)** | Val: $-1$ <br>Pr: $0.25(0.1) = .025$ | Val: $1$ <br>Pr: $0.25(0.3) = .075$ | Val: $0$ <br>Pr: $0.25(0.6) = .15$ |

Note that the total probabilities sum to 1 and each row and column sums to the probability of playing that row or column. 

We can work out the expected value of the game to Player 1 (summing all payoffs multiplied by probabilities from top left to bottom right): 

$\mathbb{E}[P_1] = 0(0.05) + -1(0.15) + 1(0.3) + 1(0.025) + 0(0.075) + -1(0.15) + -1(0.025) + 1(0.075) + 0(0.15) = 0.075$

Therefore P1 is *expected* to gain 0.075 per game given these strategies. Since payoffs are reversed for P2, P2's expectation is -0.075 per game. 

### Zero-sum
We see in the matrix that every payoff is **zero-sum**, i.e. the sum of the payoffs to both players is 0. This means the game is one of pure competition. Any amount P1 wins is from P2 and vice versa. 

### Nash equilibrium
A **Nash equilibrium** means that no player can improve their expected payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. That is, if in Nash equilibrium, changing one's strategy can only result in the same or worse payoff (assuming the other player does not change).  

In RPS, the Nash equilibrium strategy is to play each action $r = p = s = 1/3$ of the time. I.e., to play totally randomly. 

Playing a combination of strategies is called a **mixed strategy**, as opposed to a **pure strategy**, which would select only one action. Mixed strategies are useful in games of imperfect information because it's valuable to not be predictable and to conceal your private information. In perfect information games, the theoretically optimal play would not contain any mixing (i.e., if you could calculate all possible moves to the end of the game). 

The equilibrium RPS strategy is worked out below: 

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="minimal"}
## Nash equilibrium strategy for RPS
| Player 1/2 | Rock   | Paper  | Scissors |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Rock ($r$)**  | (0, 0)  | (-1, 1) | (1, -1)  |
| **Paper ($p$)** | (1, -1) | (0, 0)  | (-1, 1)  |
| **Scissors ($s$)** | (-1, 1) | (1, -1) | (0, 0)   |

If Player 1 plays Rock with probability $r$, Paper with probability $p$, and Scissors with probability $s$, we have the following expected value equations for Player 2: 

$\mathbb{E}[P_2(R)] = 0r -1p + 1s$

$\mathbb{E}[P_2(P)] = 1r + 0p - 1s$

$\mathbb{E}[P_2(S)] = -1r + 1p + 0s$

(To compute each of these, sum the payoffs for each column with P2 payoffs and P1 probabilities. P2 payoffs because we are calculating the expected payoffs for P2 and P1 probabilities because the payoffs depend on the strategy probabilties of P1 against each of P2's actions.)

Since no action dominates, we know that the EV of every strategic action should be equal (since if a certain strategy was best, we'd want to always play that strategy). 

To solve for $r$, $p$, and $s$, we can start by setting these EVs equal: 

$\mathbb{E}[P_2(R)] = \mathbb{E}[P_2(P)]$

$-1p + 1s = 1r - 1s$

$2s = p + r$

Then setting these equal: 

$\mathbb{E}[P_2(R)] = \mathbb{E}[P_2(S)]$

$-1p + 1s = -1r + 1p$

$s + r = 2p$

And finally setting these equal: 

$\mathbb{E}[P_2(P)] = \mathbb{E}[P_2(S)]$

$1r - 1s = -1r + 1p$

$2r = s + p$

Now we have these equations:  

$$
\begin{cases}
2s = p + r \\
s + r = 2p \\
2r = s + p
\end{cases}
$$

We can rewrite the 1st: 

$r = 2s - p$

And combine with the 2nd: 

$s + (2s - p) = 2p$

$3s = 3p$

Resulting in: 

$s = p$

Now we can go back to the 2nd equation: 

$s + r = 2p$

And insert $s$ = $p$: 

$s + r = 2s$

And arrive at: 

$r = s$

We now see that all are equal: 

$s = p = r$

We also know that they must all sum to $1$: 

$r + p + s = 1$

Since they're all equal and sum to $1$, we can substitute $p$ and $s$ with $r$: 

$3r = 1$

$r = 1/3$

So all actions are taken with probability $1/3$: 

$r = p = s = 1/3 \quad \blacksquare$

By symmetry, the same equilibrium strategy is true for Player 2. 
:::

Playing this strategy means that whatever your opponent does, you will breakeven! For example, think about an opponent that always plays Rock. You'll play Rock 1/3 of the time and tie, Paper 1/3 of the time and win, and Scissors 1/3 of the time and lose. 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}(\text{Equilibrium vs. Rock}) &= 0(r) + 1(p) + -1(s) \\
&= 0(1/3) + 1(1/3) + -1(1/3) \\
&= 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

How about the case of the opponent playing 60% Rock, 20% Paper, 20% Scissors? 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}(\text{Equilibrium vs. 622}) &= 0.6(\text{Equilibrium vs. Rock}) \\ 
&\quad{}+ 0.2(\text{Equilibrium vs. Paper}) \\  
&\quad{}+ 0.2(\text{Equilibrium vs. Scissors}) \\
&= 0.6(0) + 0.2(0) + 0.2(0) \\
&= 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

The random equilibrium strategy will result in 0 against *any* strategy. This means any pure strategy and any combination of strategies including *622* and the opponent playing the random strategy themselves. 

### Exploitation compared to Nash
The equilibrium strategy vs. a pure Rock opponent is a useful illustration of the limitations of playing at equilibrium. The Rock opponent is playing perhaps the worst possible strategy, yet equilibrium is still breaking even against it! 

What's the best that we could do against Rock only? We could play **purely paper**. This is called a **best response** strategy. Any deterministic strategy can be fully exploited. 

The payoffs are written for playing Paper and the probabilities indicate the opponent playing only Rock. 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}(\text{Paper vs. Rock}) &= 1(r) + 0(p) + -1(s) \\
&= 1(1) + 0(0) + -1(0) \\
&= 1
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

We'd win 1 each game playing Paper vs. Rock. Though now always playing Paper means that the opponent could always play Scissors and then we'd become the loser.

How about against the opponent playing 60% Rock, 20% Paper, 20% Scissors? Here we can see that because they are overplaying Rock, our best strategy is again to always play Paper. We write the payoffs for playing Paper and the probabilities according to the *622* strategy. 

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}(\text{Paper vs. 622}) &= 1(r) + 0(p) + -1(s) \\
&= 1(0.6) + 0(0.2) + -1(0.2) \\
&= 0.6 + 0 - 0.2 \\
&= 0.4
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$

Playing Paper vs. *622* results in an expected win of 0.4 per game. 

### Playing against equilibrium and non-equilibrium opponents
We know that in RPS, the equilibrium strategy is 1/3 Rock, 1/3 Paper, 1/3 Scissors. The **support** of the equilibrium is defined as the set of actions that are played with at least some probability. In this case, it's all 3 possible actions. 

As long as you play any strategy in the support, you will have the same payoff against the equilibrium (in this case always breaking even). This means that if you are playing against a combination of equilibrium and non-equilibrium opponents, you could actually ignore the equilibrium opponent since you'll always breakeven against them, and just target the non-equilibrium opponent(s).
