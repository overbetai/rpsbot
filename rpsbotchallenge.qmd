RPS bot challenges are coming soon! 

In these challenges, there are always suboptimal "house bots". Think bots that always play Rock or always play the sequence "RPSRPSRPS...".

This means that playing the *game theory optimal* strategy will not maximize your payoff against them. 

The challenge is to predict what they're doing, and to play well against opponents without getting counterplayed yourself, and perhaps to counterplay those who are prioritizing beating the house bots! 

## Rock Practice Gym
Test your bot against a variety of our house bots in our Rock Practice Gym. 

## Daily Challenge
Play up to 200 games against a single RPS bot each day. 

The bots will get roughly more difficult as the week goes on from Monday to Sunday. They'll be all different types -- our own house bots, human-created bots from our weekly challenges, LLM-generated, etc. 

You can play against the bot with your own bot, manually, or both. We have tools to help write your own bot even if you don't know how to code. 

**[200 games? min? max?]**
**[What about the timer play every second thing?]**
**[Do daily ones also enter into the weekly?]**

## Weekly Challenge
Enter your best bot to play against that week's other human-made bot entrants as well as a selection of our own house bots that will vary with a new theme each week. You'll play every other entrant for 1000 games.  

Entries start each Monday and end each Sunday, with results posted the Monday after.

Each week has a special rookie division for those who are entering for their first time. 

**[Maybe: Some feedback mechanism to improve and resubmit throughout week, at least against house bots?]**

## Hackathon
We periodically run virtual and in-person hackathons that we'll announce on RPS.bot and on our [mailing list](https://overbetai.substack.com/)/social channels.

The hackathons are run over a few hours with new rounds every 30 minutes. The format is similar to the weekly challenge above, where you face off against other human-made bots and our own house bots. We enter a new selection of progressively smarter house bots every round. Once a house bot enters, it stays in for subsequent rounds. 

After each round, you can see the entire play history against each bot and a matrix score report.

You can submit multiple times during a round, and for each submission, you'll get a test result showing how your bot would have performed in the *previous* round. Doing better in the previous round is a sign of progress, but may not actually result in a better score in the current round, which will have updated participant bots and new house bots.
