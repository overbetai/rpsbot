2) Separate weekly competition for non-1st time people (all non-1st time people + assortment of house bots) 

3) Daily RPS v1 is X number of games vs. one of the weekly competition bot entrants from the previous week (or from whenever, or also including occasional LLM or house bots). You can elect to play vs. the bot manually, with some-code, or full-code. 

4) Daily RPS v2 is “Medium level” from below, but can we sustain this? But also if we do #3 above is that going to get 

### Competition Rounds
There will be 5 rounds of RPS competitions. Each will have: 

- 1 bot entered by each participant
- 4 new house bots

You'll play 200 games against each other bot twice. 

Before each round, you'll be given the next round's name, which will be a hint about the strategies for all of those bots. 

### House Bots
Each house bot that enters during a round will stay for all future rounds. 

The bot names reveal the bot strategies. The names will be anonymized during each round and then revealed afterwards (except for the final round where they will be revealed, but won't be that useful!).  

### Submissions
- For each round, you can submit as many times as you want up to the end of that round
- Starting in the 2nd round, each submission *during* the round will receive a *test result* based on how that bot would have done in the *previous* round 
  - Doing better in the previous round is a sign of progress, but may not actually result in a better score in the current round, which will have updated participant bots and new environment bots
- The final submission before the end of the round will be entered into that round's competition (and will stay active for future rounds as well until you submit a new one)
- At the end of each round, we'll run the tournament and show the results

### Scoring
At the end of each round, you'll get the following information: 

- Matrix score report with results against every other bot
  - Your score is reported as profit per 100 games
- Game histories for each match

Your cumulative score is the sum of all of the round scores, where the first round is worth 1x and each future round increases by 1.3x (_i.e._, round 2 is 1.3x, round 3 is 1.69x, etc.). 

### Prizes
There will be a small on-theme prize for the overall winner. 

## Strategy
Your mission is to play well against the environment bots without getting counterplayed by other participant bots. 

### Strategy vs. House Bots
The histories that are shown against the bots will generally be very useful in discovering patterns. Combine this with the bot names, and you'll be able to develop a strong strategy against these bots for future rounds. 

### Strategy vs. Participant Bots
Look for patterns. If participant bots are only trying to exploit environment bots, then they might be exploitable themselves.
